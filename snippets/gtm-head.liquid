  Tags are segments of code provided by analytics, marketing, and support vendors to help you integrate their products into your websites or mobile apps. 
  With Google Tag Manager, you no longer need to add these tags directly to your projects. 
  Instead, you configure and publish tags and how they fire from within the Tag Manager user interface. 

  Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments (aka tags) on your website or mobile app.

  Important: Do not defer the GTM code snippet.
